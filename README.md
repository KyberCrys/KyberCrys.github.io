# <ins> Cohort 3 Team 2 project (Maybe replace this with game name if we think of one?) <ins/>
## <ins> Game description <ins/>
Insert game description here.<br/>

(Remove once website finished) Example image insert code below, though you can just drag and drop an image into the README.md file, and github does the rest, which is how I added the image below for testing, also change image once game screenshots available<br/>

## <ins> Assets used <ins/>:
This section could include the links to any assets that we used for our game that we did not make, (or assets we did make if we want)<br/>
[Asset used](Link to the asset used)<br/>

(Remove once website finished)According to the assessment paper, we may not be allowed to put diagrams or screenshots in our documents, hence the next few sections are for diagrams, gantt charts, etc.<br/>
If so, a suitable refencing system will be needed for the files below, eg Gantt1 for the first gantt chart, and these would be placed in the deliverables, though this may only be needed for additional content<br/>
